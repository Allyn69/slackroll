		<h1>SlackRoll Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

		<h2>Current working directory</h2>

		<p><strong>Question</strong>: SlackRoll using
		the current working directory makes it very tedious
		to <em>cd</em> into the chosen directory, and if you
		forget it it may create directories and files in
		the wrong location. Can you change this?</p>

		<p><strong>Answer</strong>: It's a design decision,
		so you can have several package lists or mirrors with
		different configurations, making it more flexible.
		If you detect you frequently make those mistakes or
		would like to simplify the situation, you should
		consider one of the following alternatives:</p>

		<p>Putting <em>slackroll</em> inside the chosen
		directory, preventing mistakes by having to run it as
		<em>./slackroll</em>.</p>

		<p>Creating a script or shell function
		to <em>cd</em> into the chosen directory
		automatically. For example, I have the following
		lines in my superuser <em>$HOME/.bashrc</em> file:</p>

		<p><code>slackroll() { ( cd /var/slackroll &amp;&amp;
			command slackroll "$@" ); }</code></p>

		<p>Where <em>/var/slackroll</em> should be changed
		for your chosen directory.</p>

		<h2>Packages with nonstandard names</h2>

		<p><strong>Question</strong>: While attempting to setup
		SlackRoll I get "<em>Error: Nonstandard package name:
		&lt;package&gt;</em>". How can I solve this problem?</p>

		<p><strong>Answer</strong>: It seems some people are
		using packages that don't follow the Slackware package
		name convention of <em>name-version-arch-build</em>.
		I think it is wrong to have a package that doesn't
		follow the convention. SlackRoll needs to parse
		the package names to extract the different components.
		These packages make it very difficult or impossible,
		so they are rejected. There is no way to create an
		algorithm to analyze those names properly. The
		problem should be solved by removing that package,
		renaming the package archive to have a standard name
		and then installing it again.</p>

		<p>Some examples of invalid package names I have seen
		reported:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><em>pyfloppy-1.6-noarch.2AS</em>
			(Should be <em>pyfloppy-1.6-noarch-2AS</em>?)</li>

			<li><em>gammapage-0.5.i486-1AS</em>
			(Should be <em>gammapage-0.5-i486-1AS</em>?)</li>

			<li><em>scons-0.96.1-1.noarch</em>
			(Should be <em>scons-0.96.1-noarch-1</em>?)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Remember: it doesn't matter if it's an official
		package or a foreign or custom one. It should follow
		the naming convention.</p>

		<h2>Saving the list of URLs</h2>

		<p><strong>Question</strong>: Using the <em>urls</em> or
		<em>show-upgrade-urls</em> operation I want to save the
		URL list to a text file. However, if I use shell
		redirections and SlackRoll prompts me to select a
		specific package version, I can't see the questions.
		Is there an easy way of doing this?</p>

		<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes. Pipe the output of
		SlackRoll to <code>tee url-list.txt</code> and then edit
		the file to remove the extra lines.</p>

<title>SlackRoll Frequently Asked Questions</title>
</head>
<body>
<div id="header">
<h1>SlackRoll Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
</div>
<h2>Current working directory</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p><strong>Question</strong>: It's tedious to <tt>cd</tt> into the chosen directory everytime I want to
use SlackRoll. Furthermore, if you forget about it, SlackRoll may create
directories and files in the wrong location. Can you change this?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: It's a design decision, so you can have several package lists or
mirrors with different configurations, making it more flexible, as well as
giving you the option to choose the package cache location. If you detect
you frequently make those mistakes or would like to simplify the
situation, you should consider one of the following alternatives:</p>
<p>Putting <tt>slackroll</tt> inside the chosen directory, preventing mistakes by
having to run it as <tt>./slackroll</tt>.</p>
<p>Creating a script or shell function to <tt>cd</tt> into the chosen directory
automatically. For example, I have the following line in my superuser
<tt>$HOME/.bashrc</tt> file, where <tt>/var/slackroll</tt> should be changed by your
directory of choice:</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>slackroll() { ( cd /var/slackroll &amp;&amp; command slackroll "$@" ); }</tt></pre>
</div></div>
</div>
<h2>Packages with nonstandard names</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p><strong>Question</strong>: While attempting to setup SlackRoll I get <em>"ERROR: Nonstandard
package name: &lt;package&gt;"</em>. How can I solve this problem?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: It seems some people are using packages that don't follow the
Slackware package name convention of <em>name-version-arch-build</em>. I think it
is wrong to have a package that doesn't follow the convention. SlackRoll
needs to parse the package names to extract the different components.
These packages make it very difficult or impossible, so they are rejected.
There is no way to create an algorithm to analyze those names properly.
The problem should be solved by removing that package, renaming the
package archive to have a standard name and then installing it again.</p>
<p>Some examples of invalid package names I have seen reported:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
pyfloppy-1.6-noarch.2AS
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
gammapage-0.5.i486-1AS
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
scons-0.96.1-1.noarch
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: it doesn't matter if it's an official package or a foreign or
custom one. It should follow the naming convention.</p>
</div>
<h2>Saving the list of URLs</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Using the <tt>urls</tt> or <tt>urls-upgrades</tt> operation I want to save the URL
list to a text file. However, if I use shell redirections and SlackRoll
prompts me to select a specific package version, I can't see the
questions. Is there an easy way of doing this?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes. Pipe the output of SlackRoll to <tt>tee url-list.txt</tt> and then
edit the file to remove the extra lines.</p>
</div>
<h2>Coordinating with rsync</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p><strong>Question</strong>: I normally get my remote packages using rsync, so as to keep a
local copy of the remote tree. Can I coordinate this with SlackRoll?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes. I would use a script like the following one, replacing the
chunks in curly braces by the appropriate contents.</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>SLACKROLL_DIR={path to slackroll working directory}
LOCAL_MIRROR_DIR={path to local copy of the tree}

{rsync command(s)}

cd $SLACKROLL_DIR
slackroll update
rm -f packages/*
for pkg in $( slackroll path-search '' | grep '\.tgz$' ); do
    ln -sf $LOCAL_MIRROR_DIR/$pkg ./packages
done</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<p>This will synchronize your local copy of the remote tree and then populate
the SlackRoll package cache with symbolic links to the package archives
located inside your local copy of the Slackware remote tree. From the
point of view of SlackRoll, it's like if it had already downloaded every
package.</p>
</div>
<h2>Comparing SlackRoll to other tools</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What are the differences between SlackRoll and other tools like
slapt-get, swaret or slackpkg?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: That's a hard question which is better answered by exposing the
features of SlackRoll. In any case, it should be clarified that you can
run two types of Slackware installations. On the one hand you have stable
releases. If you are going to run a stable release any tool will probably
be useful enough for you, including SlackRoll. This is because stable
releases are easy to manage, given that the only events they are exposed
to are the release of patches. Any of the existing tools can easily tell
you which patches have been released and let you automate the download and
installation process. It is extremely rare, but not impossible, for a
package to be added to or removed from the tree of a stable release.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can be running the testing tree of Slackware, also
known as slackware-current. In this case, in my humble opinion, SlackRoll
is the best tool. This is because SlackRoll lets you track almost any
event happening in the testing tree, be it packages being added, removed
or upgraded, including the events of a foreign package getting an official
version and the removal of a package for which a customized version was
installed. This is possible thanks to its package states foundation and
the absence of a blacklisting mechanism in favour of working with two
differentiated states: foreign and frozen. No other tool, as far as I
know, can deal with as many events as SlackRoll. I'm unable to imagine an
event that is not covered by SlackRoll.</p>
<p>Apart from the type of Slackware installation you're running, there's the
issue of using external repositories like the one from LinuxPackages.net.
I wouldn't recommend using it because, in my own experience, too many
packages from that site have been built on nonstandard systems. Some of
them have weird dependencies and other ones simply won't work in your
system, because they are submitted by people running many unofficial
builds of official packages. I am not saying that they are all faulty, but
the failure rate I've been getting is simply too high, always in my
opinion. If you want to use these external repositories you want to run
<strong>slapt-get</strong>, but take into account your resulting system can in many cases
not be considered Slackware anymore, due to the high number of unofficial
builds you will be running. It will be something close to Slackware. A
customized Slackware if you prefer.</p>
<p>If you are not going to use external repositories, or packages from those
external repositories are the exception in your system, the dependency
mechanism of slapt-get is useless, and you may well be runing SlackRoll,
which tracks more events. Another point of failure in slapt-get is that it
uses a version comparisson algorithm to decide if a package should be
upgraded or not. It can fail and, more commonly, it fails to detect
package reverts, which happen from time to time in slackware-current,
forcing you to pay a lot of attention to the change log.</p>
<p>Compared to the shell-based <strong>swaret</strong> (there's a new swaret being developed
in Perl), SlackRoll lacks tracking binary dependencies, but it compensates
that lack by letting you query the Slackware Package Browser from the
command line comfortably. Apart from that, swaret is incredibly slow and
CPU hungry even when it's only downloading files from the network, and
doesn't come close to tracking as many events as SlackRoll. SlackRoll is,
in my humble opinion, a clear winner over swaret unless you absolutely
love the binary dependency resolution it provides. For me that's a minor
feature. The Perl implementation is supposed to be basically the same, but
solving the high CPU usage problem. If that's the case, SlackRoll would
still be a much better option, in my opinion, because swaret still doesn't
do glibc upgrades properly, does not detect removed packages, etc.</p>
<p>SlackRoll's closest friend is <strong>slackpkg</strong>, included in the /extra/ tree. You
can think of it like a very much improved slackpkg that works faster,
detects more corner cases and has more features. If you run slackpkg, do
not hesitate to give SlackRoll a try.</p>
<p>Finally, in general, SlackRoll is at least as fast or faster than any of
the above tools, specially faster than the ones that are big shell scripts
(slackpkg and swaret). It downloads less metadata than any other, because
it only needs FILELIST.TXT and, for convenience, the new entries from the
change log (indeed, it only downloads the new entries). It detects more
events, which is specially useful when running slackware-current. And it
has some useful features no other tool has, like the operations to detect
orphan files and broken symlinks. You won't have to run grep on the
contents of /var/log/packages anymore, because it has a local search
operation, and also a remote search operation that lets you query the
Slackware Package Browser comfortably from the command line and receive
the results on your terminal. And it also lets you choose which package
version to install when there are several ones available. It lets you
upgrade individual packages or every upgradeable package, install new
packages, remove old ones, search for package names or packages with a
given tree component, list alternative versions of packages, detect and
warn you about activity in glibc packages (giving them priority while
upgrading too), etc.</p>

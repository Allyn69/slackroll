<description><![CDATA[
	<p>slackroll v44 has been released. This version fixes some documentation bugs and adds an option to get a shell to run arbitrary commands after kernel-related operations without exiting the program (similar to stopping the program with Ctrl+Z). In addition, while slackroll is still published to the public domain, the approach has changed from a mere public domain note to CC0, as recommended by the FSF and others, in order to increase legal safety.</p>

	<p>slackroll v43 has been released. This version adds support for external repositories. The introduction and tutorial has been updated and is a recommended read. slackroll veterans could simply read the "Remote trees" subsection and the "External repositories" subsection. Also, see the help for the "add-repo", "list-repos" and "remove-repo" operations.</p>

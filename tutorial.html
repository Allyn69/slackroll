	<h1>Target audience</h1>

	<p><code>slackroll</code> is a package or update manager for Slackware systems. It does not provide dependency checking and uses <code>pkgtools</code> to install or upgrade packages. It&#8217;s designed to work with official mirrors. If you have a Slackware system mainly composed of official packages and a handful of unofficial packages, <code>slackroll</code> can help you manage it and keep in touch with the remote tree. It tries to know when new packages appear, when packages are removed and when packages are upgraded.</p>

	<h1>Before you start</h1>

	<p>So you have decided to try <code>slackroll</code>. Let me introduce a few concepts so you don&#8217;t get lost.</p>

	<p>In the following text I&#8217;m going to be talking about packages. For package, we are going to understand a named piece of software, without having any specific version unless I explicitly mention it. A package can be <code>bash</code> or <code>kdewebdev</code> or <code>gcc-gfortran</code>, for example.</p>

	<p>Each package is in one of several possible states. The program tries to keep a persistent &#8220;database&#8221; that associates each package with its state.  When it runs, it analyzes the list of packages present in your system, the list of remote packages, and tries to keep the persistent database updated by introducing new entries, deleting old ones and changing the state of some of those entries. There are several possible states for a package, divided in two groups. First, we have transient states. As a user, your job is to make sure no packages remain in those states for long periods of time. Second, we have the normal states, in which the different packages should normally be.</p>

	<h2>States to avoid (transient states)</h2>

	<h3><span class="caps">NEW</span></h3>

	<p>A package is in this state when it&#8217;s present in the remote tree and it wasn&#8217;t present before. If you detect you have packages in this state you should decide if you want to install them or mark them as not installed. This state lets you see which packages are being added to the remote tree.</p>

	<h3><span class="caps">UNAVAILABLE</span></h3>

	<p>Sorry if this name is somehow confusing. A package is in this state when it&#8217;s present in your system, but not in the remote tree. You should decide if you want to remove them from your system or mark them as foreign packages. This state lets you see which packages are being removed from the remote tree.</p>

	<h3><span class="caps">OUTDATED</span></h3>

	<p>A package is outdated if it&#8217;s present in your system and in the remote tree, but the local version does not match any relevant one in the remote tree. The program will try to upgrade these packages.</p>

	<h2>Normal states</h2>

	<h3><span class="caps">INSTALLED</span></h3>

	<p>A package is installed if it&#8217;s present in your system and in the remote tree, and the local version is not outdated. Very common state, as you can suppose.</p>

	<h3><span class="caps">NOT</span> <span class="caps">INSTALLED</span></h3>

	<p>A package is not installed if it&#8217;s a known package which is not present in your system but exists in the remote tree. It&#8217;s also a very common state.</p>

	<h3><span class="caps">FROZEN</span></h3>

	<p>No package will enter the frozen state unless you mark it so. It should be used for packages present in your system and in the remote tree, but that you don&#8217;t want to upgrade automatically.  This state can be used for packages which are not meant to be upgraded automatically or ever, like <code>aaa_elflibs</code> and others, and probably for customized versions of official packages. For example, my custom build of <code>freetype</code> is marked as frozen. You must pay attention to these packages, as upgrades to them will be silently ignored. You may find the <code>list-versions</code> and <code>list-outdated-frozen</code> operations useful to detect version mismatches between your local copy and the ones in the remote tree. Having a package in the frozen state does not prevent you from using the install operation to download and install a different version. If the package ever disappears from the remote tree, it will be marked as unavailable and you will probably see it. You could continue to use it by marking it as foreign if you wish.</p>

	<h3><span class="caps">FOREIGN</span></h3>

	<p>No package will enter the foreign state unless you mark it so. It should be used for packages that do not exist in the remote tree but that, unlike unavailable packages, are present in your system on purpose. For example, the <code>slackroll</code> package in my system is marked as foreign. A foreign package will be marked as installed or outdated if it ever appears in the remote tree, becoming a candidate for upgrading. Hopefully, you&#8217;ll notice this fact. You could still use your own version instead of the remote (official) one by marking it as frozen.</p>

	<h1>Get slackroll</h1>

	<p><a href="http://github.com/rg3/slackroll/downloads">slackroll</a> is a self-contained Python script released to the public domain. You can install its package with <code>installpkg</code> for the first time. In the future, you can use <code>upgradepkg</code> or even <code>slackroll</code> itself to upgrade to newer versions. Continue reading for more details.</p>

	<h1>Getting started</h1>

	<p><code>slackroll</code> requires <code>python</code>, <code>pkgtools</code>, <code>gnupg</code> (or <code>gnupg2</code>), an editor and diff tool (which are <code>vim</code> and <code>vimdiff</code> by default (provided by package <code>vim</code>), and a pager (<code>less</code> by default) to operate properly.</p>

	<p>It should be noted that you can start using <code>slackroll</code> whenever you want, but my advice is to do it when your system is under control and there are no upgrades pending. This will give you a chance of configuring the program and setting the package states properly without making serious mistakes.</p>

	<p>You should first choose a Slackware mirror. In case your mirror of choice offers access using both <span class="caps">FTP</span> and <span class="caps">HTTP</span>, prefer <span class="caps">HTTP</span>. Take into account <code>slackroll</code> will store downloaded packages in a subdirectory of <code>/var/slackroll</code>, so you will probably need to have a good amount of space available for them in there. Set the mirror <span class="caps">URL</span> with the <code>set-mirror</code> operation. For example:</p>

	<p><code>
slackroll set-mirror &#39;http://example.org/slackware-current/&#39;
</code></p>

	<p><strong>Do not forget the trailing slash!</strong> Great. You are ready to start. Retrieve the remote <span class="caps">GPG</span> key to add it to your key ring. Having the <span class="caps">GPG</span> key is required, and it should be safe to do this step even if the key is already in your key ring. You can also get the key from the Slackware CD or <span class="caps">DVD</span>. The <span class="caps">GPG</span> key and the package signatures will be downloaded from a primary mirror instead of the mirror you chose, in order to increase security.</p>

	<p><code>
slackroll import-key
</code></p>

	<p>Retrieve information about the remote packages. You&#8217;ll have to perform this step every time Patrick Volkerding changes the remote tree.</p>

	<p><code>
slackroll update
</code></p>

	<p>Finally, you could start checking if there are new packages, unavailable packages or upgrades. However, the first time you use <code>slackroll</code>, any package not installed in your system will be marked as new, every foreign package will be marked as unavailable, and every customized package will probably be a candidate for upgrading if you try to do so. If you have your system under control (and I hope you do!), you can in most cases blindly mark all new packages as not installed. There&#8217;s a command to do it, being a common first operation.</p>

	<p><code>
slackroll new-not-installed
</code></p>

	<p>In most cases, you can also mark any unavailable packages as foreign.  However, the number of foreign packages is usually quite low, and forgetting to uninstall a package which has been removed is a very common mistake, so my advice is to review the list of unavailable packages by hand, detecting which ones may not be foreign packages and need to be uninstalled.</p>

	<p><code>
slackroll list-unavailable
</code></p>

	<p>Once you&#8217;ve got rid of old packages (using <strong>removepkg</strong> or the <code>remove</code> operation), mark the rest as foreign packages.</p>

	<p><code>
slackroll unavailable-foreign
</code></p>

	<p>Some people like to &#8220;blacklist&#8221; packages so they are not upgraded normally. Almost always, you want to do this with the package <code>aaa_elflibs</code> if it&#8217;s present in your system, and maybe with some other packages. If you don&#8217;t want them to be upgraded normally, they belong to the frozen state.  Mark them as frozen. The same applies to customized builds of official packages.</p>

	<p><code>
slackroll frozen aaa_elflibs
</code></p>

	<p>The frozen operation accepts a list of packages as its arguments. You don&#8217;t need to issue a separate command for each one of them.</p>

	<p>Regarding customized versions of official packages, there are at least three ways of dealing with them. Some people prefer to give them version names that match the official ones, despite being customized builds, and keep them in the installed state. The program will want to upgrade them automatically in that case, and maybe the official version will overwrite the custom one after an upgrade, before you rebuild it, if you don&#8217;t mark it as frozen in the mean time. Some other people prefer to do the same but putting the package permanently in the frozen state. In that case, <code>list-outdated-frozen</code> is useful to detect version mismatches between your local copy and the remote ones. Finally, some other people prefer to give them custom version names, normally via personalized build numbers that usually include some packager initials, and mark them as frozen. In that case, <code>list-versions</code> can help you see if your local copy needs to be rebuilt for a new version.</p>

	<h1>Normal operation</h1>

	<p>First off, <code>slackroll help</code> will give you a summary of the most common operations, plus some advice. You can read a brief description of every supported operation by running <code>slackroll help all</code>. Finally, you can get specific help for an operation using <code>slackroll help OPERATION</code>, where <code>OPERATION</code> is the name of the operation you want to get help for.</p>

	<p>This program is not a perfect tool. I think it can handle almost every situation and be told to do exactly what you want, but reading the change log and subscribing to the <code>slackware-security</code> mailing list is highly recommended.</p>

	<p>In any case, the most frequent command you will probably run is <code>slackroll update</code>, which should be run whenever the remote tree is changed. Then, you should read the change log with the <code>changelog</code> operation if there are new entries and, finally, the <code>list-transient</code> operation will provide a summary of activity. There should be no packages in transient states after you&#8217;re finished dealing with the changes.</p>

	<p>Watch out for upgrades in the <code>glibc-solibs</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>pkgtools</code> packages. They should (almost) always be the first ones to be installed or upgraded in that order, even before new packages. You can use the <code>upgrade-key-packages</code> operation to upgrade them first. The program will try to inform you about changes in those packages with a noticeable warning.</p>

	<p>New packages should either be installed selectively with the <code>install</code> operation or all at the same time with <code>install-new</code>. New packages which will not be installed should be put in the not-installed state with <code>not-installed</code>.</p>

	<p>Outdated packages should be upgraded, normally using the <code>upgrade</code> operation.</p>

	<p>Unavailable packages could either be foreign packages that you forgot to mark as such, and should be marked with <code>foreign</code>, or packages which have been removed from the remote tree. In that case, <code>remove</code> or <code>remove-unavailable</code> are the operations you will be looking for.</p>

	<p>When installing or upgrading foreign packages, you can use <strong>installpkg</strong> or <strong>upgradepkg</strong> and then mark them as foreign if needed. However, you can also install them using the <code>install-foreign</code> operation to save time and avoid problems in the future.</p>

	<p>Also, remember to run the <code>clean-cache</code> operation from time to time to get rid of old and outdated package archives stored in the package cache.</p>

	<p>The order described above is the order in which you should proceed in most cases. However, sometimes it&#8217;s not the correct order. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to read the change log to detect possible special cases and read comments by Patrick Volkerding. If you break that order, slackroll will emit a warning, but it is only a warning. The choice of what to do is on you.</p>

	<h2>Kernel upgrades</h2>

	<p>When kernel packages have pending upgrades, you can use two operations created specifically to handle the situation. <code>kernel-upgrade</code> will install the new kernel packages using <code>installpkg</code> instead of <code>upgradepkg</code> and then help you configure your boot loader for the new kernel. This means that, for a small time period, you will have two versions of the kernel packages installed. After a successful reboot to the new kernel, you can use the <code>kernel-clean</code> operation to remove the previous versions of those packages.</p>

	<h1>Feedback, questions, bug reports</h1>

	<p>I&#8217;m all open for good bug reports and general feedback but I&#8217;m, as always, reluctant to change the main program concepts, like adding support for multiple mirrors, or adding dependency support or probably adding more package states. I also know the program currently can&#8217;t be used to upgrade the system in non-interactive mode (like calling it from a cron entry).  That is very unlikely to change, because when there&#8217;s an upgrade, there&#8217;s no easy way to decide which version should be installed if a package has a version in the main tree, another one in <code>/extra/</code> and another one in <code>/testing/</code>, so it&#8217;s always going to need user input.</p>

	<p>If you have a question, you should first read the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>. For other questions, comments or suggestions, <a href="http://rg03.wordpress.com/contact-me/">contact me</a> by email, or report an issue in the issue tracker.  Keep in mind I&#8217;m using the program under <code>slackware-current</code>. If you detect a problem under the stable version, please report it as soon as possible because it may go unnoticed to me.</p>

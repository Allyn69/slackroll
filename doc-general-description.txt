+slackroll+ is a package or update manager for Slackware systems. It does
not provide dependency checking and uses +pkgtools+ to install or upgrade
packages. It's designed to work with official mirrors. If you have a
Slackware system mainly composed of official packages and a handful of
unofficial packages, +slackroll+ can help you manage it and keep in touch
with the remote tree. It tries to know when new packages appear, when
packages are removed and when packages are upgraded.

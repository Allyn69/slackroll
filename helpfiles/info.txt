info PKG...

This operation expects a list of package names or specific package versions,
and will print information about the selected packages. This information is
obtained from two sources. It can be from the .txt files present for every
package in the remote repository. These are used when the package is not
present in your system. If it is, the same information (plus a little bit more)
is printed by extracting it from the initial lines of the package file present
in /var/log/packages.

add-repo URL...

This operation adds one or more URLs to the list of external repository URLs.
An external repository is a non-official URL were Slackware packages can be
found. For external repositories to work properly with slackroll, they need to
have a file named FILELIST.TXT at the path indicated by the URL, with the exact
same internal format as official mirrors.

In addition, they could have MANIFEST.bz2 files in standard format just like an
official mirror. If present, this makes it possible to search for specific files
in packages from that repository using the manifest-related operations.

All packages in the external repository need to be signed with an additional
.asc file like official packages, and the key used to sign these packages needs
to be present in the superuser's keyring so they can be verified. Please note
the import-key operation will not download and import keys from external
repositories, as a security measure. They need to be imported by hand.
